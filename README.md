In this project, I analyzed toll data using Python and Power BI.

Case Study: Setting Toll Prices for a New 800km Highway

A newly planned 800km highway is set to have 4 toll booths evenly spaced at every 200km. As per Indian regulations, toll prices must be determined for both low and high motor vehicles. You have been tasked with setting these toll prices while considering various factors.

Questions for Students:

Using Python, how would you analyze the traffic flow data for nearby cities to predict the vehicle distribution on the new highway?
With the given toll locations, how would you create a graph in Python to represent the expected vehicle flow at each toll booth over a 24-hour period?
Additional Questions:

How would you assess the impact of seasonal variations, such as monsoons or festivals, on the traffic flow and toll revenues using Python?
What measures would you propose to ensure an equitable toll pricing strategy that considers the varying socioeconomic backgrounds of highway users?
How might you utilize Python to conduct a cost analysis of the toll collection process, taking into account operational expenses and maintenance costs for each toll booth?
What steps would you recommend for implementing a dynamic pricing model that adjusts toll rates based on real-time traffic conditions and demand fluctuations?
How could you analyze the environmental impact of the new highway and integrate eco-friendly toll policies using Python's data analysis capabilities?
What strategies could be employed to ensure transparency and accountability in toll collection procedures, minimizing the potential for revenue mismanagement or discrepancies?
How would you leverage Python's statistical tools to identify any correlations between toll prices, vehicle types, and the frequency of highway usage, aiding in the development of targeted pricing structures?
What innovative data visualization techniques in Python could be employed to present the toll pricing strategies and their projected impact on the highway's usage and revenue generation?
The students will have one week to collect relevant data, conduct analyses, and present their findings. They are encouraged to utilize Python's data analysis and visualization libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for effective data handling and presentation. They should also consider publicly available datasets and conduct surveys to gather essential information.
